      <h1>Business</h1>
      </div>
      <p>
        I have delivered projects in <strong>Agile</strong>, <strong>Waterfall</strong> and anything <em>in-between</em> within all areas of <strong>Banking</strong> (Retail, Business, Institutional), <strong>Technology, </strong><strong>Financial Markets</strong>, <strong>Risk </strong> and <strong>Wealth Management</strong>. <br /><br />As projects go, I have been able to ride the whole life cycle from <strong>generating ideas </strong>with the business to <strong>gathering requirements</strong>,  selecting and <strong>working with vendors & consultants</strong>, specifying the <strong>functional and technicals </strong>with our IT partners to eventual <strong>team delivery</strong>, <strong>rolling out the changes</strong> and  <strong>tracking growth</strong>. <br /><br /><em>I like it when things get done, work pushes forward and stuff just works.</em> 

        </p><br /><br /><br />

      <p class="line-break margin-top-10"></p><br /><br />

      <div class="heading">
      <h1>Tech</h1>
      </div>
      <p>
        I use a wide variety of tools for working the requirements and scenarios out,  <strong>designing</strong>, <strong>creating process flows</strong>, <strong>data and financial modelling</strong> including:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Excel</li>
          <li>Visio</li>
          <li>PowerPoint</li>
          <li>Keynote</li>
          <li>SQL</li>
          <li>Access</li>
          <li>JIRA</li>
          <li>Enterprise Architect</li>
          <li>Google Docs suite etc.</li>
        </ul>
      <p>I have also used industry-specific applications such as <strong>Risk Grading</strong>, <strong>Credit Limits</strong> and <strong>Loan systems</strong> (among others).
      </p>
      <p>  But more than tools, I profess to approaching things with a <em>clear and open mind</em> with the pencil and paper first, and writing out the problem, scenarios, design approaches and possible solutions. Then, collaboration and iteration prior to committing work to a software tool is key to creating a clear path forward quickly.  
      </p>
      
      <br /><br /><br />

      <div class="heading">
      <h1>Growth</h1>
      </div>
        <p>I will keep working to further develop these areas:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Designing</strong> - Pen and Paper, Keynote / PowerPoint, Illustrator and Photoshop, mock-ups and prototypes</li>
          <li><strong>Front End</strong> - HTML, CSS, JavaScript, JQuery and Sass</li>
          <li><strong>Web Site development</strong> - WordPress</li>
        </ul>
      <p>I will pick up <strong>Ruby on Rails </strong>again somewhere down the line. <br /><br />
        My collaboration tools of choice include <strong>Trello</strong>, <strong>InVision</strong> and <strong>Google Docs</strong>. I would be happy to hear of other tools out there - so long as we're all on the same page. </p>
      <p>And more than just learning the fundamentals, <strong>it's all about the execution</strong> at the end of the day. And so I am <em>meeting</em> some interesting people in <a href="http://www.meetup.com/" data-tooltip="Meet me here" data-placement="left">Meetups</a> along the way and hopefully build some meaningful relationships soon.

      <h1>2011 - Now</h1>
      <h3>The Recovery</h3>
      <p>There's been growth in <strong>Online Banking projects</strong>. Highlights include leading a team of BA's in delivering new registration and sign-on capabilities, ensuring the stability of the system as well as looking at user and platform coexistence.</p>
      <p>Another standout was the Securities Exchange  <strong>STP project</strong> where I partnered with the business and technology to drive requirements / design / solution end-to-end. I even managed to work with business development to help produce new market  products.</p>
      <p>Finally I was involved in a <strong>Customer Profitability</strong> project where collectively we were able to deliver the solution that sources, calculates and stores bank-wide data. Personally I was able to obtain sign-off on the methodology document at GM-level on first iteration.</p><br /><br /><br />


      <p class="line-break margin-top-10"></p><br /><br /><br />

      <h1>2008 - 2010</h1>
      <h3>The Crises</h3>

        <p> A challenging period but I managed to pick up work in <strong>Risk Management</strong> integrating the systems, processes and credit scoring capabilities between 2 major banks. </p>
        <p> I was also engaged as a consultant in 2 pieces of work: a <strong>Liquidity Management (Treasury)</strong> and <strong>Conveyance / Property Settlement </strong> program. We specified the functional specs, use cases, process and data requirements for the clients.</p>
        <p>A <strong>Reinsurance</strong> firm came knocking and I was fortunate to work closely with actuarial,  business development and IT teams to develop a product database prototype and specs for cash flow and reserve calcs.</p><br /><br /><br />

      <p class="line-break margin-top-10"></p><br /><br /><br />

      <h1>2001 - 2007</h1>
      <h3>The Wonder Years</h3>

        <p> I was in the midst of an <strong>Equity Derivatives</strong> project just as GFC hit. I worked my way within Front-Middle-Back Office areas to produce process maps. I was also involved in a lot of tech initiatives for an Investment Bank.</p>

        <p>Still a standout in my career has been the <strong>Basel 2</strong> program in<strong> Institutional Banking.</strong> The work was cast far and wide - Securitisation, Repos, Off-Balance Sheet items etc. The work was complex but the team was superb.</p>

        <p>My project career started in<strong> Retail Banking</strong> and <strong>Superannuation</strong>  managing changes to the Loans system and migrating  Super & Insurance products from Melbourne to Sydney.</p><br /><br /><br />

            <p>I am on an <strong>online design-development</strong> warpath at the moment so you will occasionally find me write about it and put up something new in my <a href="thoughtsbypc.com" data-tooltip="Here to Create" data-placement="bottom">Thoughts by PC</a> site. On the odd occasion, I publish works out to <a href="https://www.behance.net/perrycarbonell" data-tooltip="Eye Candy" data-placement="right">Behance</a>.</p>

            <p><strong>Pictures</strong>, lots of them. I take pictures of random things and it's often quite hard to predict what will catch <em>my eye</em>. I hoist some of these snaps to <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/111500938@N06/" data-tooltip="my visual eye" data-placement="bottom">Flickr</a>. Do check out the pics and let me know if it catches yours.</p>

            <p>I am constantly plugged in listening to <strong>music</strong>. This could be anywhere from Jazz to Rock, Alternative, Bossa Nova, Hip-Hop, Metal, Latin and everything in-between. Here's a sample of the tunes I blast out too: <a href="http://thoughtsbypc.com/music/" data-tooltip="my musical soul" data-placement="right">Thoughts / Music.</a></p>

            <p>My <strong>book</strong> collection backlog is not looking pretty but I intermittently read. Lately I have been chilling to fiction (e.g. Matthew Reilly) but do enjoy non-fiction too (Andrew Sorkin 'Too Big to Fail'). I house my collection in Goodreads located in my other site: <a href="http://marketmeasuresaustralia.com/" data-tooltip="Market stats, Interviews and more" data-placement="bottom"> Market Measures Australia</a>.</p>

            <p>I am always open to <strong>sharing and collaborating</strong> with others on the right project. I have an open mind and willing to listen.
